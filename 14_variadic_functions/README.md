# Variadic Functions

Variadic functions can be called with any number of trailing arguments. For example, fmt.Println is a common variadic function.

A function that will take an arbitary number of ints as arguments.

Within the function, the type of nums is equivalent to []int. We can len(nums), iterate over it with range, etc.
